; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or

; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; units.ruleset is generated from units.pre, so all changes should be
